# üéÆ Wordle CLI

A command-line version of the  Wordle game, built with **Java 21**, **Spring Shell 3.4.0**, and modern best practices.

---

##  Overview

**Wordle CLI** brings the original word-guessing game to your terminal! Guess the hidden five-letter word in five 
attempts. Enjoy intuitive color-coded feedback, smart rules, and robust error handling.

---

## Features

**Gameplay:**
- Run the game with easy CLI commands
- Five attempts to guess a hidden five-letter English word
- All guesses must be exactly five alphabetic letters (no numbers or symbols allowed)
- Input is not case-sensitive, guesses are normalized
- No duplicate guesses within a game, the previous guesses are tracked
- Words not in the dictionary are allowed as guesses, as long as they fit the length and character rules

**Feedback & Game Logic:**
- üü© **Green**: Correct letter in the correct position
- üü® **Yellow**: Correct letter in the word but wrong position, never more than the letter count in the answer
- ‚ö´ **Gray**: Letter not present in the answer
- Feedback logic matches the original Wordle (duplicate letters handled correctly)

**Developer/CLI Features:**
- Colorful CLI feedback with clear messages
- Input validation and custom exceptions for several error types (I/O, empty/invalid word list, game state)
- Comprehensive logging for better debugging
- Docker support for easy deployment and execution in a containerized environment
- Modern Java codebase with **Lombok**, **JUnit**, **JaCoCo**, and a clean exception hierarchy

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Requirements

- **Java 21+**
- **Maven 3.8+**
- Developed and tested on **Ubuntu 22.04.5 LTS** (should work cross-platform)
- *(Optional)* Docker for containerized running
